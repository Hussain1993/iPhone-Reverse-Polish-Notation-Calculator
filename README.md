<p>This is an iPhone application which is an Reverse Polish Notation Calculator
This uses a stack based calculator to pop off all the operands on the stack
and when the user presses a operation button the application will perform the
operation that the user has requested and then display this on the screen, also once
the operation has been performed the result is pushed back onto the
stack to be used in a future operation</p>
